  <h1>Adjacent and Direct child selectors</h1>
  <p>
    These two help us be specific about the elements we are trying to style.
  </p>
  <h2>Adjacent selector</h2>
  <p>
    The adjacent selector uses a plus sign, which indicates we want the
    element that goes right after the first one.
  </p>
  <p>Below we have 3 buttons.</p>
  <p>
    We only want to style the buttons that have a paragraph right before it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We used this code to achieve this: p + button { background-color: tomato;
    }
  </p>
  <div id="buttonDiv">
    <button class="outside">HELLOOOO</button>
    <button class="outside">HELLOOOO</button>
    <button class="outside">HELLOOOO</button>
  </div>
  <h2>Direct child selector</h2>
  <p>
    The direct child selector is used when trying to access an element focused
    more on the structure of your code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below we have many buttons, they are all inside a form, but we also have
    one outside the form.
  </p>
  <p>We can access it with the selector we just mentioned.</p>
  <p>
    The code we used to reach it is: body > button { background-color: aqua; }
  </p>
  <form action="#">
    <div id="buttonDiv">
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
    </div>
  </form>
  <div id="buttonDiv"><button id="outside2">Button outside form</button></div>
