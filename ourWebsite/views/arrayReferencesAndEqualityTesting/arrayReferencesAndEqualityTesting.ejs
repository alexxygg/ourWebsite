  <h1>References and Equality Testing</h1>
  <p>
    When trying to compare two array sets or specific values, it will always
    return false.
  </p>
  <p>An array variable is only a reference to the set of values.</p>
  <p>["hey"] === ["hey"];</p>
  <p>false</p>

  <p>
    They can not be compared because they are only referencing the array, it
    is not the same array.
  </p>
  <p>If we are to create an exact copy, we can have it result in true.</p>
  <p>Here we created a variable for an array.</p>
  <p>
    Then we gave the variable another name additional to the first one, so the
    reference is still the same, they are pointing to the exact same array
    this time.
