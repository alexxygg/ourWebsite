  <h1>const variable used for arrays</h1>
  <p>
    We can use a const for our array variables, while still adding, removing
    and modifying the content inside the arrays. IT WORKS LIKE THIS:
  </p>
  <p>const array = ["one","two"];</p>
  <p>array.push("three");</p>
  <p>array;</p>
  <p>["one","two","three"];</p>
  <p>
    What we can not do is modify the array as an element. We can not change
    the array to a number or a string, as it was set as an array in the first
    place.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can not even change an array by updating it to the exact values, since
    JS would now see it as a different reference.
  </p>
  <p>const array = ["one","two"];</p>
  <p>array = ["one","two"];</p>
  <p>ERROR!!!</p>
  <p>
    That would create 2 arrays, which is impossible since we set our array to
    be a constant variable, it can not be changed!
  </p>
  <p>
    This is good because we can rely that our array container will be the
    same.

    We can renovate inside the house, but not change all the walls and roof.
