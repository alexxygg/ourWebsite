  <h1>EJS Layouts Tool</h1>
  <p>We need to install it with npm i ejs-mate.</p>
  <p>
    We will need to require it in our app.js file, we normally call it engine,
    since we use .engine(), but it can be called any other way.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>const ejsMate = require("ejs-mate");</li>
    <li>app.engine("ejs", ejsMate);</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are telling ejs to use this engine instead of the default one it uses
    to parse and process our code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we can create a folder called layouts, inside our views folder, and
    start creating them.
