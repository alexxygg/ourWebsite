  <h1>Event delegation</h1>
  <p>
    Event delegation helps us perform actions or run code on elements that do
    not yet exist upon loading our webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good example is with comments from users, since they will not yet exist
    on the webpage when the user is seeing a post. He/she may decide to
    comment a minute after the post has been on the user's display.
  </p>
  <p>We delegate by performing our code on the parent element.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Here is an example:</p>
  <p>We have a form we use to post comments on a webpage.</p>
  <p>
    We can add an event listener for clicks on any elements that are exactly
    an li inside our ul, whether it already exists or not.(Any other element
    would not be removed or deleted.)
  </p>
  <h3>.target</h3>
  <p>
    We can do this with .target, which selects whatever the user interacted
    with. It is run after the event object!
  </p>
  <h3>nodeType</h3>
  <p>
    nodeType checks the element type, it will return the type of what the user
    clicked, which we need here to make sure we don't delete something other
    than a comment.
