  <h1>Form action=</h1>
  <p>
    When creating a form it will ask us to enter something for action, this is
    where the information entered in our input box will go. THe form
    submission can go to our own servers, but also to any other website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are examples of using the name attribute on other websiteÂ´s input
    names to be able to search something from our own page.

    Google News uses the letter q for the name of their input on the search
    bar. The form below has named the input q as well, so anything entered
    here will search their website.
  </p>
  <p>The form action was https://news.google.com/search</p>

  <h2>Search Google News!</h2>
  <div id="buttonDiv">
    <form action="https://news.google.com/search">
      <label for="GoogleNewsSearch">Search Google News:
        <input type="text" id="GoogleNewsSearch" name="q" placeholder="Search" /></label>
      <button class="btn btn-outline-success">Search Google News</button>
    </form>

    Reddit happens to have the same name of q, so again that will be the name
    for the input we will be using.
  </p>
  <p>The form action was https://www.reddit.com/search</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Search for something on Reddit!</h2>
  <div id="buttonDiv">
    <form action="https://www.reddit.com/search">
      <label for="SearchReddit">Search Reddit:
        <input type="text" name="q" id="SearchReddit" placeholder="Search" /></label>
      <button class="btn btn-outline-success">Search Reddit</button>
    </form>
