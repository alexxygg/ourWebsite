  <h1>Function Expressions</h1>
  <p>
    We already know how to create a function, but there is another way, the
    function expression!.
  </p>
  <p>Here we have both examples, they behave the same when called.</p>

  <p>
    The second function doesn't have a name, but is instead stored in a
    variable, which DOES.
  </p>
  <p>
    This type of function shows that functions are values in JS, which can be
    stores, passed around,etc. like with an array or string.
