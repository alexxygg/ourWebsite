  <h1>id Selector</h1>
  <p>
    The id selector helps us style a specific element from our HTML, which we
    must have identified as an id beforehand.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to note that there can only be one id with the same name
    per HTML page.
  </p>
  <p>Here we have 5 buttons, the third one has an id called third.</p>
  <p>That code has been left as a comment below this paragraph.</p>
  <!--<button id="third">IÂ´m the 3rd button!</button>-->
  <p>
    We used this code to style that specific button's background-color: #third
    { background-color: sienna; }
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that since it is an id, it needs a hashtag before the name of the
    id when styling on our CSS page.
