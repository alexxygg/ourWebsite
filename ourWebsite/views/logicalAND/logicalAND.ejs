  <h1>Logical Operator AND &&</h1>
  <p>It is represented with two ampersands together.</p>
  <p>
    It will have values or expressions on its left and right, BOTH need to be
    true for the code to be true, if one is not, the whole code results in
    false:
  </p>
  <h2>true && true;</h2>
  <p>7 > 1 && 1 < 50;</p>
      <p>true</p>
      <h2>true && false; / false && true;</h2>
      <p>false</p>
      <h2>false && false;</h2>
      <p>false</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We can use this logical operator to combine conditions, like in our
        previous password checking conditional,
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we easily combined the two factors or pieces of logic we were
        checking for with the AND logical operator.

        Or here, where we check to see if the word starts with a capital P, AND
        that the length is more than 5 characters long, AND that there is a number
        7 in it.
