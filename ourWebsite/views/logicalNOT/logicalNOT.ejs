  <h1>Logical !NOT Operator</h1>
  <p>
    The logical operator NOT is represented by an exclamation point, and
    basically makes everything the opposite of what it normally would be.
  </p>
  <h2>!true;</h2>
  <p>false</p>
  <h2>!false</h2>
  <p>true</p>
  <h2>!null</h2>
  <p>true</p>
  <h2>!(5 === 5)</h2>
  <p>false</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Here is an example:</p>
  <p>
    If we do NOT get a truthy string, we will tell the user to enter a valid
    country.An empty string would be falsy or false.

  <h2>AND &&, OR ||, NOT! COMBINED</h2>
  <p>
    It can also be applied when trying to exclude a certain group, other than
    targeting all the other groups except one of them.
  </p>
  <p>Here we are targeting all age groups except ages 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.</p>

  <p>Or here where we exclude ages 0 to 4 and 66 or older.</p>
