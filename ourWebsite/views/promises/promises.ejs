  <h1>Promises in JavaScript</h1>
  <p>
    A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of
    an asynchronous operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we eat our vegetables, we may be promised to have ice cream. Like a
    guarantee of something happening depending on other factors.
  </p>
  <p>The object can be pending, resolved or rejected. The status changes.</p>
  <p>
    We wait for the returned value to run code 1 or code 2, depending on the
    result.
  </p>

    have all 3 in our code.
