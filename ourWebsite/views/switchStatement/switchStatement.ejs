  <h1>switch Statement</h1>
  <p>It can replace multiple if statements.</p>
  <p>
    It is very important to have break; included after every case, otherwise,
    the code will do what the first matching case says, but also all the
    subsequent code, like a car without BREAKS!
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, instead of an else statement, we use default: , which also goes
    inside the curly brackets.
  </p>
  <p>
    It works just like an else, so if the entry does not match any of our
    cases, that is the action that will be performed.
  </p>
  <p>Here is an example made with if/else if/else:</p>

  <p>Here is the same but made with a switch statement.</p>
  <p>
    We have a case for each number of day, and a default option in case none
    of the cases are matched.

  <p>We can also have multiple cases do the same thing.</p>
  <p>Here, if we enter a day number between 1 and 5, it will be considered a weekday.(Weekdays in this case being from
    Monday to Friday)</p>
  <p>And a weekend day for 6 and 7.(Saturday and Sunday)</p>
  <p>Same default as before.</p>
