  <h1>The DOM</h1>
  <p>
    The DOM or Document Object Model is a JavaScript representation of a
    webpage.
  </p>
  <p>It's a window into the contents of said webpage.</p>
  <p>It is the sum of objects that we can interact with via JS.</p>
  <p>HTML and CSS go in, and a JS object comes out.</p>
  <p>
    There is a tree that shows us the relationship of each element with
    each-other.
  </p>
  <p>They are nested respective to the parents or children, etc.</p>
  <p>
    The document object includes everything in the webpage. It is our entry to
    the DOM. We can see representations of all our content, it is the root of
    our tree.
  </p>
  <p>We can see it with console.dir(document).</p>
