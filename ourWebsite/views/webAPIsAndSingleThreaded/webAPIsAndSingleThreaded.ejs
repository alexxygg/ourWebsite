  <h1>Web API'S and JS Single Threading</h1>
  <p>
    JS only has one thread, meaning it can not multi-task, only switch between
    tasks.
  </p>
  <p>It only works in one thing at the time.</p>
  <p>When we use a setTimeout function, the browser helps us.</p>
  <p>
    Browsers come with Web API's that can handle certain tasks in the
    background
  </p>
  <p>
    The JS call stack recognizes these API functions and passes them off to
    the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's as if JS asked the browser for a reminder to do a certain task after
    certain time, while it does other things to keep productivity at peak.
